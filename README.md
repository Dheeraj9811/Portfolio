Welcome to my personal portfolio website built with React and Vite!

## Features

- **User-Friendly Content Management:** This portfolio is designed to be highly user-friendly when it comes to updating content. The use of separate data files, such as `skilldata.jsx`, allows for effortless content management without the need to delve into the core codebase.

- **Modular Organization:** Content is organized in modular files, making it easy to locate and update specific sections. This modular approach enhances maintainability and simplifies the process of adding or modifying content.

- **React's Dynamic Rendering:** While not explicitly dynamic in the traditional sense, this portfolio leverages React's capabilities for dynamic content rendering. Components are designed to dynamically display content from separate data files, offering flexibility and ease of customization.

## Work to Be Completed 


- Add contact section
- Implement user-Friendly editing profile page
- Redesign project section for aesthetic appeal

Feel free to use this template for your own website, and please give credit if you do.
